enigma2 translations
====================

Enigma2 uses ".po" extension for translations which you can find them
in "po" folder and start translating in your desired language using some tools like https://poedit.net

A PO file is made up of many entries, each entry holding the relation
between an original untranslated string and its corresponding translation.
All entries in a given PO file usually pertain to a single project,
and all translations are expressed in a single target language.

Read more about PO files: https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/PO-Files.html

Don't forget that a new language file must be considered in "po/Makefile.am"
as a "po" file is just the source file of a language and it has to be compiled
into a ".mo" file and then you can define it in enigma2 python files as a new language.

You will need a "linux" based system in order to properly update the files.
You don't need to setup a full build environment but there are some pre-requisites,
the following commands must be installed and available in path on your system:
- git-core
- gawk (GNU awk)
- find
- gsed (GNU sed)
- python
- gettext (for the tools: xgettext, msguniq, msgmerge, msgattrib, msgfmt, msginit)

How to create updated "po" files including latest strings?

Follow these steps:

1- git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/OpenVisionE2/enigma2-openvision.git
2- cd enigma2-openvision
3- cd po
4- ./updateallpo-multiOS.sh

You'll have the latest "enigma2.pot" and all updated ".po" files.

You can start updating your language file and send it as a github PR to:
https://github.com/OpenVisionE2/enigma2-openvision-po/tree/master/po

Hint: The "enigma2.pot" file is the template that you can use to create new ".po" files.

Remark: by installing "brew" on OSX and then the pre-requisite packages with "brew install",
you can also generate the .po and .pot files.
