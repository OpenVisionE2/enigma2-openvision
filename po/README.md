Enigma2-PO
==========
* If you want to add a new language use https://github.com/OpenVisionE2/enigma2-openvision-po/blob/master/po/enigma2.pot as your pot file but keep in mind this is just the beginning, adding a new language to enigma2 requires developer knowledge but don't worry about that.

* If you want to update an existing language check https://github.com/OpenVisionE2/enigma2-openvision-po/tree/master/po and send us a PR.

* For updating po files it's better to use https://poedit.net
